 * drums2.c: Another example of how to pass data to a callback,
 * inspired by Alessandro Rubini's similar example in his article for
 * Linux Magazine (http://www.linux.it/kerneldocs/devfs/)
 *
 * Like the original drums.c, this example creates a bunch of devices
 * in the /dev/drums directory: /dev/drums/bam, /dev/drums/bum, etc.
 * However, it also uses the private_data structure to keep per-file
 * state, and return a string unique to each user of the device.
 *
 * Note, unlike the original drums.c, this driver does not use *offset
 * to remember if this user has read before; cat /dev/drums/X will
 * read infinitely
