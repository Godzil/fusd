	Modified to work with the 2.6 kernel and devfs.

v 1.10: August 19, 2003

	First UCLA release -- no longer publically maintained or released
	by Sensoria.  This version is the UCLA (public) fork.

	Kernel module now, finally, has correct fine-grained locking that
	does not assume atomicity of kernel code.  In other words, FUSD is
	now safe for SMP machines, preemptible kernels, etc.

	Python bindings have been contributed by Brian Warner.
	
	The old /dev/fusd control file has been moved into a subdirectory,
	/dev/fusd/control.
	
	Human-readable status is now available in /dev/fusd/status.

	By doing an ioctl() on /dev/fusd/status, it can also give you
	binary status information -- reads will return an array of
	fusd_status_t structures.
	
	Many, many subtle bugs have been fixed (e.g. rare race
	conditions).

	Lots of updates and bug-fixes to the documentation, which was
	carefully read by a number of people who were actually trying to
	use it.
	
	
v 1.04: February 5, 2002

	Change from the point of view of clients: Selecting on an FD being
	provided by a FUSD driver will return as part of the exception set
	if the driver disappears.  Useful for client programs that want to
	gracefully handle driver crashes.

	Some changes to get semantics of poll_diff (closer to) correct -
	will require some more changes later
	
	Reduced max number of messages dispatched per call to
	fusd_dispatch.  very slightly less efficient, but more fair.
	
	Protocol change - max name length now 47 instead of 31

	Minor kernel module fixes: Fixed the malloc.h/slab.h confusion,
	and added MODULE_LICENSE.

	Minor API change: fusd_register now takes a const char *
	name instead of a char *name.

	Documentation fixs and a clarification of the license.

v 1.00: September 28, 2001
